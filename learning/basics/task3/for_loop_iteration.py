"""
Given list contains all prime numbers in range 1-100. Write code to ask user to type number in range 1-100,
then check if this number is in the prime_numbers list, if it is, print that the number typed by user is prime,
if it's not - print that it is complex number. Also check if number provided by user is in allowed range,
if not ask as long as user will provide correct number

Tip: use `while` loop to check if provided number is correct, and `for` loop to iterate over prime_numbers list
not necessary to create function, but you can if you want to.
